Hello World repository for Git tutorial
This is an example repository for the Git tutoial on https://www.w3schools.com

This repository is built step by step in the tutorial.
it is to show github has a good editor too.
pull is combination of fetch and merge. 
so, if you want to merge directly, then use git pull
only if you want to see what is the diff then use fetch first and git diff, git log etc.
